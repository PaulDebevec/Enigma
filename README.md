# Enigma Rubric

### Functionality(4)
In functionality I have Enigme#encrypt and Enigma#decrypt successfully implemented. This project also has a fully working command line interface.
Last for functionality, I successfully completed the cracking method with a command line interface.

### Object Oriented Programming(3)
My project is broken out into 4 classes, all with single responsibility. All classes contain logical components related to that class. All methods are under 7 lines, and no class is over 60 lines. Variable names clearly communicate their purpose

### Test Driven Development(3)
Every method is tested at both unit and integration level.
My git history shows that all tests were written first to follow TDD. Test coverage is 100%.

### Version Control(3)
 As of writing this the repo contains 56 commits and 12 pull requests. All commits will show that there is single piece of functionality in each commit.


### Summery
All in all this was a difficult project in that the logic was a struggle to grasp at first, though the more I researched the easier it became and the pieces fell into place.
